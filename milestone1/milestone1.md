Project Proposal 
Target user population: People with missing loved ones or pets (aka “missing targets”). 
Project theme: This fits the project theme because none of us in our group have ever lost someone or something important to us to the point we needed to initiate a large scale search needing community support. We also want to provide a resource so that people have to go through fewer problems and less stress in their searches as these times can be emotionally challenging. Our application is meant to help our target user population in its search and enable efficient community support.
This application is intended to have two main user options
Searcher: The person looking for a missing target. 
Good Samaritan: A person wanting to lend their help in finding a missing target. 
APIs
Waze: The Waze GPS application has a feature that allows people to notify other drivers of where cops are located. We plan to take this feature and modify it so that people can pin drop areas they might have seen the missing target. 
NamUs: This is a repository of information of missing people across the United States. It has several critical features such as name, image, and last sighting that we can implement into our application.
