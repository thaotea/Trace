Please inquire with the shelter.<p/> Current Location: In RASKC Foster Home <p/>Karl is a big guy with a matching cattitude. He would be best as the only pet in the house unless he could get a proper (and long) introduction, as he thinks he is the alpha male. In foster care he tolerates three other cats that are all submissive. He was traumatized by the death of his owner when he was brought in to RASKC, and after two months in foster care he has settled down quite a bit. Sometimes he will jump up on your lap, headbutt you and purr, and a few minutes later hiss and jump down. At this time he needs a forever home with lots of attention so he can settle into being a happy cat all of the time. Note that it has taken several weeks to get to where he is now and will likely regress some when he moves. It will require some patience but it will be well worth it as he can be a big, loving and cuddly kitty. He'll even sleep under the covers with you.<p/><p/>Karl is not a picky eater and is 100% when it comes to the litter box. He marks his ""territory"" with a headbutt only and does not spray (whew!). He loves his cardboard scratching post and is absolutely crazy about catnip and his catnip banana. A laser pointer is a must as is a feather on a string for play. He is an exclusively inside cat but does like to spend some time in the catio to get away.<p/><p/>You can meet Karl at his foster home and have any of your questions answered.<p/>",RED

I would love to find a home with an equally active and social family. I love enrichment and I am quite smart, figuring out puzzles with my food is very fun for me! I'm not a big snuggly guy, I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>",RED

She came in with baby kittens and was a wonderful, nurturing mama to her babies and now deserves a nice, relaxing home to call her own. She is still young herself and likes to chase her feather toy and run after balls. She will make a great sofa companion and prefers to be next to you.""<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE.

I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home! I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)    Allergic dermatitis<p/>This animal's skin condition is suspected to be caused by allergies.  An allergy is an over-reaction of the immune system to an allergen.  Allergies may affect the skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal system.  Symptoms may include itching, inflammation and hair loss, coughing, sneezing or digestive disorders.  Allergies can be caused by environmental factors, fleas or foods.  Allergies can lead to secondary problems such as skin and ear infection, or asthma.  Controlling the allergen is the best treatment.  Antihistamines, medicated shampoos, hypoallergenic diets and routine flea control are some treatment options.  We recommend that you consult with your regular veterinarian about this condition.  Continued veterinary care and additional treatment will be needed.<p/><p/><p/>2)    Otitis externa.  The external ear canal has an infection due to yeast and/or bacteria.  Proper medication and routine ear cleaning is needed to resolve this infection.  Often otitis externa is related to allergies.  Routine otic exams are recommended.  An educational handout is provided.<p/><p/>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p/><p/>- Special diet or prescription foods<p/>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p/>- Special skin care or shampoos<p/>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p/>- Possible surgery<p/>",GREEN
